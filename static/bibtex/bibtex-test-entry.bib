	abstract = {Remote attestation is a crucial security service particularly relevant to increasingly popular {IoT} (and other embedded) devices. It allows a trusted party (veriﬁer) to learn the state of a remote, and potentially malware-infected, device (prover). Most existing approaches are static in nature and only check whether benign software is initially loaded on the prover. However, they are vulnerable to runtime attacks that hijack the application’s control or data ﬂow, e.g., via return-oriented programming or data-oriented exploits.},
