      interestDesc:
        'One of the largest problems with modern day operating systems is their monolithic nature. I am particularly interested in OSes with a microkernel design, although these are esoteric and have not seen wide adoption, microkernels are (in my opinion) the more secure architecture for operating systems.',

      interestDesc:
        'In recent years, the large movement of small internet-connected devices have brought up some new interesting security problems. I am particularly interested in secure IoT operating systems, and secure ecosystems of IoT devices.',

      interestDesc:
        'Secure hypervisors are more than just a technology to run a VM on, one way of providing isolation to various components of a monolithic system is through virtualization; however, providing strong security mechanisms in a hypervisor is no easy task.',

      interestDesc:
        'Data science is no longer a current research interest of mine, in my undergrad I wrote a honours thesis <a href="https://service.scs.carleton.ca/content/honours-project-2021-winter-ant-72">Extending Heterogeneous Recommenders Beyond First-Party Datasets</a>. I still plan on learning about data science; however, I see it as a means to an end.',
