Most software written on embedded systems tends to be written in C; however, I believe that the memory safety guarantees of Rust provides an attractive solution for the next-generation of embedded systems software."

        "interestDesc": "One of the largest problems with modern day operating systems is their monolithic nature. I am particularly interested in OSes with a microkernel design, although these are esoteric and have not seen wide adoption, microkernels are (in my opinion) the more secure architecture for operating systems."

I still plan on learning about data science; however, I see it as a means to an end."
